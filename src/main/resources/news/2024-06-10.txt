France declares war on Rome!

With tensions in the mediterranean reaching a boiling point,
France has declared war, citing Rome's "ridiculous" claims
on the coast. French divisions have already been deployed
to occupy Southern France, while Roman divisions are still
unprepared to ward off the invasion. The French leader, reshaped,
cites the war as "the reclamation of land that was unlawfully stolen"

The Baltic States have also announced their support of France
to retake the south, having sent several volunteer forces
to aid the French war effort.
